# student-interview-minecraft-template-java

A template repository for all Student Interview 'Mini Projects' for Minecraft: Java Edition. This template is written in Java

# Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Docker Desktop
- A Java-compatible IDE (We recommend IntelliJ IDEA)

# Setup
- Start the SQL Server (and any other external dependencies needed for the project) by running `docker compose up -d`
- Build the project by running `./gradlew build` (or `gradlew.bat build`)
- Start the Minecraft server by running `./gradlew runServer`

You can then connect to the server by typing connecting to `localhost` on a Minecraft 1.21 Java Edition Client

# Stuck? Don't have a Computer?
Don't worry at all! Speak to the hiring manager for the role, and they will set you up with a timeslot to come and visit us in office
to get support on this mini project. It's better to get help than to suffer alone.
